Hosting Projects from Raspberry Pi_11

This repository contains a small experimental project created for learning and personal exploration. The project involved hosting a simple webpage from a Raspberry Pi and experimenting with basic Python scripting and web deployment.

The files in this repository reflect hands-on practice and experimentation rather than production-ready code. Any included wordlists or scripts were used strictly for educational purposes in a controlled environment.
